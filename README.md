# Connect4-MiniMax

Final Project for Artificial Intelligence cs311 at Middlebury College. 

This project includes functionality for playing two minimax Connect4 players against each other. Heuristics can be changed in the "Run.java" file to differ results of the games. The players that can be chosen from are "Offensive", "Defensive", "Location", and "Balanced." Each of these players makes slightly different moves based on the heuristic scores attributed to them.
